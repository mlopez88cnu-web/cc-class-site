# Target Buyer Persona: "Marketing Maria"

## Title & Role

**VP or Director of Marketing** at a B2B SaaS company (50–500 employees, $10M–$150M ARR).

Reports to the CMO or CEO. Manages a lean team of 3–10 marketers and owns the pipeline number alongside sales.

---

## Demographics

- **Age:** 32–48
- **Experience:** 8–15 years in B2B marketing, 2–5 years in current role
- **Education:** Bachelor's or MBA; may hold certifications in HubSpot, Google Ads, or Marketo
- **Compensation:** $160K–$250K OTE, often with a variable component tied to pipeline or revenue targets

---

## Goals

1. **Hit pipeline and revenue targets** — measured quarterly, reported to the board
2. **Prove marketing's impact on revenue** — move beyond MQLs to pipeline-sourced and pipeline-influenced metrics
3. **Scale programs without scaling headcount** — do more with the same or smaller budget
4. **Shorten the sales cycle** — equip sales with better content, warmer leads, and clearer attribution
5. **Build a repeatable demand engine** — reduce dependence on one-off campaigns and founder-led sales

---

## Pain Points

- **Attribution is a mess.** Multiple tools, incomplete data, and no single source of truth connecting spend to closed-won revenue.
- **Team is stretched thin.** Expected to run paid, organic, events, content, ops, and web with a small team and flat budget.
- **Agency fatigue.** Past agencies delivered vanity metrics, missed deadlines, or didn't understand B2B sales cycles.
- **Pressure from the board.** CAC is climbing, investors want efficient growth, and every dollar needs justification.
- **Sales-marketing misalignment.** Sales says leads are garbage; marketing says sales doesn't follow up. No shared data to settle it.

---

## Buying Behavior

- **Research-first.** Reads peer reviews on G2/Clutch, asks in CMO Slack communities, and checks LinkedIn before ever filling out a form.
- **Skeptical of agencies.** Wants proof — case studies, specific metrics, and references from companies at a similar stage.
- **Values speed to value.** Won't wait 6 months for results. Expects a 30/60/90 plan with early wins.
- **Needs internal buy-in.** Has to justify the spend to a CFO or CEO; needs clear ROI projections and a concise business case.
- **Decision cycle:** 2–6 weeks from first conversation to signed SOW.

## Objections to Anticipate

| Objection | Response |
|---|---|
| "We've been burned by agencies before." | We share live dashboards, do weekly syncs, and tie every dollar to pipeline. No black boxes. |
| "We can't afford to add another vendor right now." | Our clients typically see 3–5x ROI within the first two quarters. We'll model it out before you sign. |
| "My team can handle this in-house." | We're not here to replace your team — we fill the gaps (paid, ops, analytics) so they can focus on strategy. |
| "How long until we see results?" | Quick wins in the first 30 days (audit, low-hanging fruit). Measurable pipeline impact by 90 days. |
