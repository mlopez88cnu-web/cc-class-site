## Project Overview

Marketing site for The Lopez Group, a B2B digital marketing agency. The site's goal is to convert VPs and Directors of Marketing at B2B SaaS companies ($10M–$150M ARR) into strategy call bookings by speaking directly to their pain points, addressing their skepticism of agencies, and giving them tools (like the ROI calculator) to build internal buy-in with their CFO/CEO.

## Tech Stack

Plain HTML, inline CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks, no build tools, no dependencies. Everything lives in a single `index.html`.

## Writing Copy

Always read `persona.md` before writing or editing any copy. Use the persona's language (pipeline, closed-won, CAC, QBR, board deck, headcount). Frame everything around their problems first, then our solutions. Address objections directly — don't avoid them.
